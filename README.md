# dbt BigQuery Setup Guide

This README documents the full setup process for a dbt project using **Google BigQuery** as the data warehouse. It includes all commands used, along with explanations.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- `gcloud` CLI configured with your GCP account
- BigQuery dataset and project already created

---

## üß∞ Step-by-Step Setup with Commands

### 1. ‚úÖ Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv dbtProjects


source dbtProjects/bin/activate
Purpose: Enables the virtual environment so all pip packages are installed locally.

pip install dbt-core dbt-bigquery

Purpose: Installs the dbt CLI and the plugin needed to connect to BigQuery

dbt --version
Purpose: Verifies that dbt is installed and shows which adapters are available.

dbt init dbtproject
Purpose: Creates a new folder (dbtproject/) with the dbt project structure and optionally sets up your BigQuery connection.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you hit Ctrl+C, you might need to manually set up ~/.dbt/profiles.yml

cd dbtproject
Moves into the generated dbt project folder

dbt debug
Validates installation, profiles.yml, and confirms connectivity to BigQuery.

dbt run           # Run all models
dbt test          # Run tests defined in schema.yml
dbt compile       # Compile SQL without running
dbt docs generate # Generate documentation site
dbt docs serve    # Launch local documentation viewer

Setting Up profiles.yml
The profiles.yml file is how dbt knows how to connect to your data warehouse ‚Äî in this case, Google BigQuery.

‚úÖ Where Should It Be Located?
It must be located in the following path on your system:

bash
Copy
Edit
~/.dbt/profiles.yml
That translates to:

On Linux/Mac: /home/<your-username>/.dbt/profiles.yml

On Windows (PowerShell): C:\Users\<your-username>\.dbt\profiles.yml

üìù This file is user-specific and lives outside your dbt project folder.
